/*
    INHERITANCE : There is a super-class which has attributes that are inherited from by the sub-class. 
    a.k.a parent-child relationship where the child inherits from the parent and the child can have other kids that also inherit from 
    itself and from the main parent class

    e.g

        1. There is a base class of Animal
        2. There is another class inheriting from Animal and the name of this class is Bird
        3. There is another class inheriting from Bird and this class is called Eagle

        NB: TO SHOWCASE THE RELATIONSHIP OF CLASSES IN Js WE USE THE KEYWORD extends
            i.e. class Eagle extends Bird

 *  TDD :
 *      1. Write a failing test
 *      2. Re-write code to pass
 *      3. Optimize code without changing the results
 *

 *  
 *  VERSIONS OF TESTING
 *      1. MANAGEMENT'S PERSPECTIVE : Ensuring that a piece of software works with other parts of your system
 *      2. SOFTWARE ENGINEER'S PERSPECTIVE : Writing code that doesnt break existing functionality, bug free and satisfies given reuirements
